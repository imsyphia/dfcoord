# dfcoord

> Minecraft worldgen utility that generates coordinate-providing density functions

The program will generate density functions `syph:x` and `syph:z` for the provided dimension seed, 
as well as any other additional required data files. The files are put in a namespace folder `syph`
which can be easily included in a data pack. The density functions are not exact, however they have
rather low error.
